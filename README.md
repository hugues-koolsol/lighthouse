# lighthouse score for pwa
A php program to compute the score of pwa according to the lighthouse score.
This program has to be run on a localhost php environment.
It runs several times google chrome (canary) audit for all urls that are in an array at the beginning of the program.

The global score i have chosen is computed like this : 10 * pwa score   +   4 * performance score   +   3 * accessibility score   +   2 * best practices score   +   1 * seo

Some pwa have a 💯 for all the lighthouse scores : pwa, performance, accessibility, best-practice and seo . 
It is not very easy to get a 💯 for all these scores but some can reach this challenge 💪 :-)
