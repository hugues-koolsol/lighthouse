# lighthouse score for pwa
A php program to compute the score of pwa according to the lighthouse score.
This program has to be run on a localhost php environment.
It runs several times google chrome (canary) audit for all urls that are in an array at the beginning of the program.

The global score I have chosen is computed like this : 10 * pwa score   +   4 * performance score   +   3 * accessibility score   +   2 * best practices score   +   1 * seo

I did set a tolerance for performance for two reasons:

   1Â°) lighthouse is a little inconstant when you exceed a score of 95.
   
   2Â°) in the case of a pwa, the first loading can be a little slow but the following ones are very fast.<br />
   
As a result, a score >= 95 is considered to be equal to 100.


Some pwa have a ðŸ’¯ for all the lighthouse scores : pwa, performance, accessibility, best-practice and seo . 
It is not very easy to get a ðŸ’¯ for all these scores but some can reach this challenge ðŸ’ª :-)
