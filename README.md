# lighthouse score for pwa
A php program to compute the score of pwa according to the lighthouse score.
This program has to be run on a localhost php environment.
It runs several times google chrome (canary) audit for all urls that are in an array at the beginning of the program.

The score is computed like this : 10 * pwa score   +   4 * performance score   +   3 * accessibility score   +   2 * best practices score   +   1 * seo

Some pwa have a 100 for all the lighthouse scores : pwa, performance, accessibility, best-practice and seo . 
It is not very easy to get a 100 for all these scores but some can reach this challenge ðŸ’ª :-)
